Custom filters block popular trackers, banners, loading and displaying ads on site pages and in search results, and these lists include cosmetic filters for problematic sites.

This project is under MIT license (see [License](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bogachenko/presstheattack/master/LICENSE.md)) and its creator — [Bogachenko Vyacheslav](https://github.com/bogachenko)

The overall goal of the project is to block ads and reduce traffic coming from the domains and websites you visit.
The term "advertising" in this project is not defined because, as I said above, apart from the obvious advertising, I also block cosmetic banners and tooltips which I think create useless traffic without any real benefit.

My list is not limited to any region. However, my personal attention is paid to the English and Russian regions, as I speak these languages.

## Disclaimer

You may find these rules to be overly zealous. Yes, I pay special attention to spying on users, developing and tracking, as well as hidden mining.

However, if you find that one or several rules violate the website, break it, determine the problem rule and use the comments, disable it through the plugin settings and then create a question in the [issues](https://github.com/bogachenko/presstheattack/issues).
