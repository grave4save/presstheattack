Custom filters blocking popular trackers, banners, loading and displaying ads on website pages and search results, it also includes cosmetic filters for problem sites.

This project is the original, it is under the MIT license (see [License](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bogachenko/presstheattack/master/LICENSE.md)) and created it [Bogachenko Vyacheslav](https://github.com/bogachenko)

The overall goal of the project is to block ads and reduce traffic coming from domains/websites that you visit.
The term "ads" is not defined in this project, because as I said above, besides the obvious ads, I also block cosmetic banners and tooltips, which, as I think, create useless traffic without any real benefit.

My list is not restricted by any region. However, my personal attention is English and Russian regions since I speak these languages.

## Disclaimer

You may find that these rules are overzealous, I pay special attention to logging, spying on users, mining and trackers.
If you find that one or more of the rules breaks the site, identify the problem rule and use the comments to disable it through the plugin settings and/or create a question in "issues".

I am not responsible for any damages you may suffer from the use of these rules, including content mistakenly hidden or violated by one of the rules in this set.

Note that I mainly use uBlock Origin. I will do my best to maintain compatibility with AdBlock Plus, but I cannot test my filter regularly with this plugin. (If you have any problem using AdBlock Plus, please feel free to raise the issue.)

## Supported Ad-Blockers

In order to use these rules, you'll need a compatibile browser plugin.

* [uBlock **Origin**](https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock) (not [uBlock](https://www.ublock.org) <sup><small>[why?](https://github.com/bogachenko/presstheattack/wiki/uBlock-Origin-vs-uBlock)</small></sup>)
	* [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/addon/ublock-origin/)
	* [Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ublock-origin/cjpalhdlnbpafiamejdnhcphjbkeiagm)
	* [Opera](https://addons.opera.com/en/extensions/details/ublock/)

Each browser and plugin are slightly different from each other, all the plugins presented above with my list filter work properly (checked personally), the plugins presented below were not checked by me personally and therefore I admit that *maybe* there will be incorrect work with some of the filters.
